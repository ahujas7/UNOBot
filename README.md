# UNOBot

UNOBot 1.0 is a small-scale vehicle which has object-avoidance and remote control capabilities.

It was designed using an Arduino Uno R3, ultrasonic sensors, an L293D motor driver, DC motors, IR sensors.

- The Arduino provides the brains of the vehicle, onto which C++ code is uploaded
- Ultrasonic sensors are used to detect surrounding objects
- An L293D motor driver allows for the control of two motors simultaneously and motor reversal
- The IR remote and sensor provide the ability for the vehicle to be controlled manually
